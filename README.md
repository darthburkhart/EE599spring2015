A Qt Repository For Learning Image Processing

If there are any questions regarding this Git please contact me at mbgi222@g.uky.edu

This is still under construction so if there are problems with a particular project just push a file with the a description of any erros or send to mbgi222@g.uky.edu with any relevant material such as compile logs and problem code.  If there is a known solution also either push onto the repository or send to me and I will post.  I am currently trying to work out all the details on this repository so be patient.

Kind Regards,
Matt
